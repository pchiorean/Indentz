# <Filename>: document name
# <Code>: any string
# <On doc>: any string: on existing document; empty or missing: on separate file

# You can use `|` for manually splitting the label into several lines.
#
# If the document name ends with a separator (space/dot/underline/hyphen) followed by a sequence
# of digits or letters equal to the number of spreads, the letter corresponding to the spread index
# will be appended to each code/file (e.g., for a document with three spreads named `Document_ABC.indd`,
# the script will generate `Document_A_QR.pdf`, `Document_B_QR.pdf` and `Document_C_QR.pdf`.
#
# The TSV file must be saved locally (in the active document folder); files starting with `_`
# take precedence. Blank lines are ignored; everything after a `#` (comments) is ignored.
