# <Find what>: text to be replaced (you can use find and replace special characters)
# <Change to>: the replacement text
# <Case sensitive>: `yes` or `no` (defaults to `yes`)
# <Whole word>: `yes` or `no` (defaults to `yes`)
# <Scope>: replacement will only be done if the document name matches the regular expression (case sensitive)
#
# The TSV file must be saved locally (in the active document folder or its parent) or as a global
# default (on the desktop, next to the script, or in Indentz root); local files and those starting
# with `_` take precedence. Blank lines are ignored; everything after a `#` (comments) is ignored.
# A line ending in `\` continues on the next line. Use `@defaults` to include the global default,
# or `@include path/to/another.tsv` for other data file. The path can be absolute, or by default
# relative to the data file; a new default path can be set with `@includepath path/to/`.
