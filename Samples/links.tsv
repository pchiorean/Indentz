# <Relink to>:
# - An absolute path of the form `/absolute/path/to/img1.psd`
# - A relative path which is:
#   - relative (by default) to the document `Links` folder
#   - relative to `base/path/` defined by a previous `@includepath` directive
#     (`img3.psd` and `subfolder/img4.psd`)
# <Links>: A list of filenames separated by commas, that if present in the document, will be
# replaced with the link from the first column; it's case insensitive and can take simple
# wildcards (`?` and `*`). The script will also automatically match the filenames from the
# first column, thus 'Links' can be empty.
#
# The TSV file must be saved locally (in the active document folder or its parent) or as a global
# default (on the desktop, next to the script, or in Indentz root); local files and those starting
# with `_` take precedence. Blank lines are ignored; everything after a `#` (comments) is ignored.
# A line ending in `\` continues on the next line. Use `@defaults` to include the global default,
# or `@include path/to/another.tsv` for other data file. The path can be absolute, or by default
# relative to the data file; a new default path can be set with `@includepath path/to/`.
