<p>This is a collection of InDesign scripts for various simple and repetitive tasks.</p>
<p>I often perform repeated, tedious, or time-consuming operations as a DTP operator, so I wrote several simple scripts to improve my workflow. Most are meant to be used with shortcuts<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> (suggestions for the Mac platform below). Some require one or more objects on the page to be selected. Apart from error alerts, they do their job silently; however, some<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> give a report if run with <strong>Ctrl</strong>.</p>
<p>The code was developed and tested in Adobe InDesign CC 2020–2023 on Mac (I mostly used <a href="https://www.indesignjs.de/extendscriptAPI/indesign8/">InDesign ExtendScript API 8.0</a>, compatibile with CS6). I’m a graphic designer, not a programmer, so be prepared for oversights and bugs (please create an <a href="https://github.com/pchiorean/Indentz/issues">issue</a> if you encounter one, though!).</p>

<p><strong>Additional features:</strong></p>
<p>A line may also contain a <em>statement</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>@includepath</code> <code>reference/path</code> – defines a folder to which subsequent relative paths will refer;</li>
<li><code>@include</code> <code>path/to/other.tsv</code> – includes another TSV file at this position; <code>path/to</code> may be absolute or relative – by default is relative to the data file folder, but if you defined a <code>reference/path</code>, it will be relative to that;</li>
<li><code>@defaults</code> – includes the global data file;</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s also some non-standard stuff that will confuse Excel et al.:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blank lines are ignored;</li>
<li>Everything after a <code>#</code> is ignored (used for commenting);</li>
<li>The fields can be visually aligned with spaces that will be ignored at processing (I use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VS&nbsp;Code</a> and <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv">Rainbow&nbsp;CSV</a>);</li>
<li>A very long line can be broken into multiple lines with a backslash (<code>\</code>) added at the end of each segment.</li>

<p>These scripts reframe the selected objects to the target area specified in the script name (page/spread or their margins, bleed or <em>visible area</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3:1">[3:1]</a></sup>).</p>
<p>For example, running <strong><code>FitToPageBleed.jsx</code></strong> (⇧F11) on these two frames will expand the yellow one and shrink the red frame to the page bleed:</p>
<p><img src="img/fit.png" alt="Example"></p>
<p>The refitting is done by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Shrinking</strong> the edges that hang outside the target area;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Extending</strong> the edges that touch or are very close to a trigger zone (which is either the target or the visible area). By default this snap zone is 1% of the visible area<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Rectangular frames and straight lines are simply reframed; rotated objects, ovals, groups etc., are first inserted into a clipping frame. Only clipped objects, straight frames and lines are extended. Frames with an embedded object are only extended to the limits of that object.</p>
<p>The <strong><code>*Forced.jsx</code></strong> variants simply reframe the objects to the target area.</p>

<h3 class="crossnote-header" id="file">File</h3>

<h4 class="crossnote-header" id="filestospreadsjsx"><strong><code>FilesToSpreads.jsx</code></strong></h4>

<p>Combines the open documents, sorted alphabetically.</p>
<h4 class="crossnote-header" id="spreadstofilesjsx"><strong><code>SpreadsToFiles.jsx</code></strong></h4>

<p>Saves each spread of the active document to a separate file.</p>
<p>If the file name ends with a <em>separator</em> (space/dot/underline/hyphen) followed by <em>a sequence</em> of digits or letters <em>equal</em> to the number of spreads, each saved spread will have the letter corresponding to its index appended to its name – e.g., a document with three spreads named <strong><code>Document_ABC.indd</code></strong> will be split into <strong><code>Document_A.indd</code></strong> / <strong><code>Document_B.indd</code></strong> / <strong><code>Document_C.indd</code></strong>. If not autodetected, the script will prompt the user for a sequence.</p>
<p>By default the index will be appended at the end, but you can put a <code>#</code> in the file name to place the index at that particular position.</p>
<h4 class="crossnote-header" id="layerstospreadsjsx"><strong><code>LayersToSpreads.jsx</code></strong></h4>

<p>Moves all layers of the active document to separate spreads (the document must have a single spread).</p>
<p>You may use <strong><code>SpreadsToFiles.jsx</code></strong> to split the result into separate documents.</p>
<h3 class="crossnote-header" id="export">Export</h3>

<h4 class="crossnote-header" id="quickexportjsx"><strong><code>QuickExport.jsx</code></strong></h4>

<p>My workflow requires frequent changes to export settings; the native export dialog has quite a few tabs and options, so I used to have a lot of Adobe PDF Presets with just a few differences. For many years I used Peter Kahrel’s wonderful <a href="https://creativepro.com/files/kahrel/indesign/batch_convert.html">Batch Convert</a>, but I’ve always wanted a tool tailored to my needs. I made this script to have the frequently changed settings easily accessible and thus reduce the number of presets to the essential; I also added some other features that make my life easier.</p>
<p>There are two selectable workflows, with the options grouped into several categories. I will review the not self-explanatory ones:</p>

<p><strong>Source folder:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>By default, all open documents will be exported. If nothing is open, this option allows you to select a folder as the source.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Preset options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After selecting an Adobe PDF Preset you can override some of its options with just a few clicks: crop marks, page information, to include or not the slug area, to export as pages or as spreads, resolution, bleed etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Document actions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Skip do-not-print layers</strong> will not export layers with names beginning with a dot or a hyphen (e.g., <strong>.safety area</strong>); you can also define a custom list with <strong>Edit list</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Run a script</strong> will run a JavaScript or AppleScript before exporting (e.g., one of the other scripts from this section).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Output options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Export in a custom folder:</strong> By default the files are exported in the same folder as the source document, but you can choose a custom one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add a suffix:</strong> This text will be appended to the name of the exported files. <strong>Note:</strong> A preset can be ‘paired’ with a suffix by adding it to its name after the <em>last</em> underscore: e.g., when you select <code>X4_350dpi_39L300_print</code>, the suffix will be automatically changed to <code>print</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sort files into subfolders by suffix</strong>: Files will be exported in a subfolder named after the suffix, up to the first <code>+</code> character: e.g., for <code>print</code> the PDF will be exported as <strong><code>print/Document_print.pdf</code></strong>; for <code>print+diecut</code>, as <strong><code>print/Document_print+diecut.pdf</code></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sort files into subfolders by date</strong>: Files will be exported in a subfolder named <strong><code>MM.DD</code></strong> (current month/day).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Overwrite existing files:</strong> The files will be overwritten <em>if</em> the destination is the same. If unchecked, the files will get unique names by incrementing their index – for example, we’ll export as <code>Document_preview3.pdf</code> if there is already a <code>Document_preview2.pdf</code> in the export folder or its subfolders.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Updating source:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Save modified:</strong> After export, modified documents can be updated (e.g., if you want to preserve changes made by a script).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Save all documents:</strong> Documents will be saved regardless if modified or not. You can also enforce a <strong>Save as</strong> for all documents – this is useful for reducing the size of documents that have been modified many times (on each regular save the document grows with the latest changes).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Global options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Upgrade [Converted] documents</strong>: Upgrade or skip documents from previous versions of InDesign.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you keep the <strong>Opt/Alt</strong> key pressed while clicking <strong>Start</strong>, the script will run without saving the settings.</p>
<p><strong>Shortcut:</strong> ⌃E</p>
<h4 class="crossnote-header" id="markvisibleareajsx"><strong><code>MarkVisibleArea.jsx</code></strong></h4>

<p>Creates a frame the size of the page margins that marks the <em>visible area</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3:2">[3:2]</a></sup>. It will use an existing <strong>Visible area</strong> swatch, or will create one with the values R=255 G=180 B=0.</p>
<h4 class="crossnote-header" id="prepareforexportjsx"><strong><code>PrepareForExport.jsx</code></strong></h4>

<p>Hides some <em>do-not-print</em> layers: <strong>covered area</strong>, <strong>visible area</strong>, <strong>safety area</strong>, <strong>segmentation</strong>, and all layers starting with either a dot or a hyphen (for the full list see the script).</p>
<p>Moves all page objects from <strong>varnish</strong>, <strong>uv</strong>, <strong>foil</strong>, <strong>silver</strong> and <strong>white</strong> to separate spreads and labels them.</p>
<h4 class="crossnote-header" id="showdnplayersjsx--hidednplayersjsx"><strong><code>ShowDNPLayers.jsx</code></strong> / <strong><code>HideDNPLayers.jsx</code></strong></h4>

<p>Show or hide some <em>do-not-print</em> layers: <strong>covered area</strong>, <strong>visible area</strong>, <strong>safety area</strong>, <strong>segmentation</strong>, and all layers starting with either a dot or a hyphen (for the full list see the script).</p>
<h3 class="crossnote-header" id="view">View</h3>

<h4 class="crossnote-header" id="tilealljsx"><strong><code>TileAll.jsx</code></strong></h4>

<p>Invokes <strong>Window ‣ Arrange ‣ Tile All Vertically</strong>, <strong>Tile All Horizontally</strong>, or <strong>Tile</strong>, depending on the current spread orientation.</p>
<p><strong>Shortcut:</strong> ⇧F4</p>
<h4 class="crossnote-header" id="zoomto300percentjsx"><strong><code>ZoomTo300Percent.jsx</code></strong></h4>

<p>Zooms current layout window to 300%.</p>
<p><strong>Shortcut:</strong> ⌘3</p>
<h4 class="crossnote-header" id="zoomtoselectionjsx"><strong><code>ZoomToSelection.jsx</code></strong></h4>

<p>It resembles <strong>Fit Selection in Window</strong> <strong><small>(⌥⌘=)</small></strong>, but with some changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brings the selection a little closer;</li>
<li>If the cursor is in a text frame, zooms on the whole frame;</li>
<li>Without anything selected zooms on the current spread.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Shortcut:</strong> F4</p>
<h4 class="crossnote-header" id="zoomtospreadsjsx"><strong><code>ZoomToSpreads.jsx</code></strong></h4>

<p>Zooms on the first 3 spreads.</p>
<p><strong>Shortcut:</strong> ⌥F4</p>
<h3 class="crossnote-header" id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>

<h4 class="crossnote-header" id="clipjsx"><strong><code>Clip.jsx</code></strong></h4>

<p>To handle some objects, it may be useful to temporarily insert them into a container (clipping frame). The script inserts the selected objects into a clipping frame or restores them if they are already clipped.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It uses the clipboard, so make sure you don’t lose anything important.</p>
<p><strong>Shortcut:</strong> Num*</p>
<h4 class="crossnote-header" id="clipundojsx"><strong><code>ClipUndo.jsx</code></strong></h4>

<p>Releases one or several objects from their clipping frames (you can select any objects, it will only release the clipped ones). If nothing is selected, it will release all clipped objects.</p>
<p><strong>Shortcut:</strong> ⌃Num*</p>
<h4 class="crossnote-header" id="eanjsx"><strong><code>EAN.jsx</code></strong></h4>

<p>This script is inspired by <a href="https://github.com/smorodsky/ean-barcode-generator"><strong>EAN Barcode Generator</strong></a> by Konstantin Smorodsky, which generates a document containing a user-provided sequence of barcodes. Occasionally, I work on flyers where I have dozens of barcodes to fill in, and I wanted to insert them semi-automatically instead of having to manually copy/paste and scale each one, so I made a simplified version that either inserted a single barcode directly into the selected object or created it in a new document. Later, however, I extended it to insert a sequence of barcodes in a multiple selection; eventually, I ended up reproducing much of the functionality of the original script. 🙂 The routine that generates the barcode is taken from the original script, refactored to make it standalone, and the rest of the code is original.</p>
<p>When nothing is selected, it creates a new document with each barcode on one page. If there are multiple frames (ideally rectangles) selected, the barcodes will be inserted in the order they were selected; if we have one barcode and multiple frames, the same barcode will be inserted into all of them.</p>
<p>Enter 8 or 13 digits for the code itself; if you have an add-on, add a hyphen and another 2 or 5 digits.</p>
<p><strong>Shortcut:</strong> ⌥F9</p>
<h4 class="crossnote-header" id="labelpagejsx"><strong><code>LabelPage.jsx</code></strong></h4>

<p>Adds a custom label on the current page slug, on the <strong>info</strong> layer (Helvetica Regular 6&nbsp;pt, fill <strong>Registration</strong>, stroke <strong>Paper</strong> 0.4 pt):</p>
<p><img src="img/labelpage.png" alt="Label Page"></p>
<h4 class="crossnote-header" id="labelpageratiosjsx"><strong><code>LabelPageRatios.jsx</code></strong></h4>

<p>Adds a label with the <em>visible area</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3:3">[3:3]</a></sup> ratio and page margins ratio on the slug of each page.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the visible area is not defined, it defaults to the page size.</p>
<h4 class="crossnote-header" id="offsetpathsjsx"><strong><code>OffsetPaths.jsx</code></strong></h4>

<p>This is a slightly modified version of <a href="https://creativepro.com/indesign-cad-tool/"><strong>OffsetPath</strong></a> by Olav Martin Kvern, which uses a clever method to create paths around selected objects at a custom offset distance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you apply a Contour-type text wrap to an object, you’re creating a path around that object—and you can specify an offset distance. The text wrap path is accessible via scripting. That means that we could apply a text wrap with a given offset, then capture the path and path points of that path, turn off text wrap, and then create a new path from those geometric coordinates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I fixed some bugs and added a default value, an option to join contours, and support for undoing.</p>
<h4 class="crossnote-header" id="qrjsx"><strong><code>QR.jsx</code></strong></h4>

<p>Adds a QR code on each spread of the active document (outside <em>visible area</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3:4">[3:4]</a></sup>, if possible) or to separate PDF files:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center">On document</th>
<th style="text-align:center">On file</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center"><img src="img/qr-ondoc.png" alt="QR on document"></td>
<td style="text-align:center"><img src="img/qr-onfile.png" alt="QR on file"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If the document name ends with a <em>separator</em> (space/dot/underline/hyphen) followed by a <em>sequence</em> of digits or letters <em>equal</em> to the number of spreads, the letter corresponding to the spread index will be appended to each code/file – e.g., for a document with three spreads named <strong><code>Document_ABC.indd</code></strong>, the script will generate <strong><code>Document_A_QR.pdf</code></strong>, <strong><code>Document_B_QR.pdf</code></strong> and <strong><code>Document_C_QR.pdf</code></strong>.</p>
<p>You can use <code>|</code> for manually splitting the label into several lines.</p>
<p><strong>Shortcut:</strong> F9</p>
<h4 class="crossnote-header" id="qrbatchjsx"><strong><code>QRBatch.jsx</code></strong></h4>

<p>Does the same thing as <strong><code>QR</code></strong> but in a non-interactive way: retrieves a list of codes from a TSV data file named <strong><code>qr.tsv</code></strong> (<a href="samples/qr.tsv">sample</a>) and adds them to existing documents or creates separate files (the suffix thing applies here as well):</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">File name</th>
<th style="text-align:left">Code</th>
<th style="text-align:center">On doc</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><strong>Document 1</strong></td>
<td style="text-align:left">Code 1</td>
<td style="text-align:center">+</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><strong>Document 2_ABC</strong></td>
<td style="text-align:left">Code 2</td>
<td style="text-align:center">+</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><strong>Document 3_AC</strong></td>
<td style="text-align:left">Code 3</td>
<td style="text-align:center"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">…</td>
<td style="text-align:left"></td>
<td style="text-align:center"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>File name</strong>: document name<br>
<strong>Code</strong>: any string<br>
<strong>On doc</strong>: any string: on existing document; empty or missing: on separate file</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The TSV file must be saved locally (in the active document folder); files starting with <code>_</code> take precedence.<br>
Blank lines are ignored; everything after a <code>#</code> (comments) is ignored.</p>
<p>You can use <code>|</code> for manually splitting the label into several lines.</p>
<p><strong>Shortcut:</strong> ⇧F9</p>
<h4 class="crossnote-header" id="showfontsjsx"><strong><code>ShowFonts.jsx</code></strong></h4>

<p>Shows all fonts used in the active document.</p>
<h4 class="crossnote-header" id="showprofilesjsx"><strong><code>ShowProfiles.jsx</code></strong></h4>

<p>Shows all color profiles available to InDesign.</p>
<h4 class="crossnote-header" id="showpropertiesjsx"><strong><code>ShowProperties.jsx</code></strong></h4>

<p>Shows properties and methods of a selected object (for debugging purposes).</p>
<p><strong>Shortcut:</strong> F1</p>
