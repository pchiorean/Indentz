# <Find what>: text to be replaced (you can use find and replace special characters)
# <Change to>: the new text
# <Case sensitive>: `yes` or `no` (defaults to `yes`)
# <Whole word>: `yes` or `no` (defaults to `yes`)
# <Scope>: replacement will only be done if the file name matches the regular expression
#
# The TSV file must be saved locally (in the active document folder or its parent folder) or as a global default
# (on the desktop, next to the script, or in Indentz root); local files and files starting with `_` take precedence.
# Blank lines and those starting with `#` are ignored. A line ending in `\` continues on the next line.
# Use `@defaults` to include the global default, or `@include path/to/another.tsv` for other file.
# The path can be absolute, or relative to the data file; a default path can be set with `@includepath path/to`.
