# You can use ShowFonts.jsx to get a tab delimited list of document fonts for copy-pasting.
#
# The TSV file can be saved locally (in the active document folder or its parent folder) or as a global default
# (on the desktop, next to the script or in Indentz root); local files and files starting with '_' take precedence.
# You can include another TSV file by inserting '@path/to/file.tsv' in the desired position, or the global default
# with '@default'. Blank lines and those prefixed with '#' are ignored. You can split a very long line into multiple
# lines with a backslash ('\') added at the end of each segment.
