# <New link path>: an absolute path, or relative to document `Links`, or relative to `@includepath`
# <Document links>: a list of document links that will be relinked if found (case insensitive;
#   `*` and `?` wildcards accepted); if the list is empty, the new link's name will be used.
#
# The TSV file must be saved locally (in the active document folder or its parent folder) or as a global default
# (on the desktop, next to the script, or in Indentz root); local files and files starting with `_` take precedence.
# Blank lines and those starting with `#` are ignored. A line ending in `\` continues on the next line.
# Use `@defaults` to include the global default, or `@include path/to/another.tsv` for other file.
# The path can be absolute, or relative to the data file; a default path can be set with `@includepath path/to`.
