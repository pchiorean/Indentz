# Filename: document name
# Code: any string
# On doc: any string: on existing document; empty or missing: on separate file

# You can insert '|' for manually splitting the label into several lines.
#
# If the document name ends with a separator (space/dot/underline/hyphen) followed by a sequence of digits or letters
# equal to the number of spreads, the code of each spread will have the appropriate suffix; when separate files are
# generated, they will be named in the same way (e.g., for 'Document_ABC.indd' with three spreads, 'Document_A_QR.pdf',
# 'Document_B_QR.pdf' and 'Document_C_QR.pdf' will be generated).
#
# The TSV file must be saved locally (in the active document folder).
# Files starting with '_' take precedence. Blank lines and those prefixed with # are ignored.
