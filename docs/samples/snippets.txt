# <Find what>: text to be replaced
# <Change to>: the new text
# <Case sensitive>: 'yes' or 'no' (defaults to 'yes')
# <Whole word>: 'yes' or 'no' (defaults to 'yes')
# <Scope>: replacement will only be done if the filename matches this regular expression
#
# The TSV file can be saved locally (in the active document folder or its parent folder) or as a global default
# (on the desktop, next to the script or in Indentz root); local files and files starting with '_' take precedence.
# You can include another TSV file by inserting '@path/to/file.txt' in the desired position, or the global default
# with '@default'. Blank lines and those prefixed with '#' are ignored. You can split a very long line into multiple
# lines with a backslash ('\') added at the end of each segment.
